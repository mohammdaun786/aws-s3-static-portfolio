🚀 Static Portfolio Hosting on AWS S3 with CloudFront | Project Completed

I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully completed my Static Portfolio Hosting project using AWS S3 and CloudFront as part of my Cloud Computing and DevOps learning journey.

This project helped me understand how static websites are hosted, secured, and delivered efficiently using AWS services.

✅ What I Implemented

Created and configured an S3 bucket for static hosting

Enabled static website hosting and set correct permissions

Added bucket policy using s3:GetObject for public access

Uploaded portfolio files including HTML, CSS, images

Built a responsive, mobile-friendly single-page portfolio

Added a Projects section with live GitHub links:

Virtual Mouse using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe

Resume Ranker Bot using NLP and automation

Income Tax Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Deployed the website using CloudFront for faster delivery and HTTPS

Documented the project and pushed the complete source code to GitHub

This project gave me practical exposure to real-world cloud deployment and helped me understand how CDNs improve performance and security. It was a great learning experience and a solid foundation for upcoming DevOps tasks.

Looking forward to learning more and building advanced cloud-based projects.
